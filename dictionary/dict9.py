# Your task is to implement a function that takes one or more dictionaries and combines them in one result dictionary.

# The keys in the given dictionaries can overlap. In that case you should combine all source values in an array. Duplicate values should be preserved.

# Here is an example:

# source1 = {"A": 1, "B": 2} 
# source2 = {"A": 3}

# result = merge(source1, source2);
# // result should have this content: {"A": [1, 3]}, "B": [2]}
# You can assume that only valid dictionaries are passed to your function. The number of given dictionaries might be large. So take care about performance.

def merge(*dicts):
    result = {}
    for d in dicts:
        for key, value in d.items():
            result.setdefault(key, []).append(value)
    return result

# Same setdefault trick as the first kata — for each key, either append to the existing list or start a fresh one. The *dicts lets the function accept any number of dictionaries cleanly.
